The book of Psalms beautifully and famously shows the breadth and depth of human emotion. It helps us “feel” our faith. in many of our songs in the past we have explored the reality of our sorrows, but with Psalm 150 (Praise the Lord), we wanted to emphasize the power of how the book of Psalms culminates - in overwhelming joy and praise! I think in 150 being the final Psalm God is teaching us something - that sorrows are real, confusion will happen, the journey is long - but it all crescendos in praise. There is an exclamation point! Joy is where we are headed. The world knows it. The seas know it. The mountains know it. And we can get in on it. ~ Matt Papa

“You formed us in your very likeness....to know your wondrous works.....to tell your mighty deeds....to join the everlasting chorus, PRAISE THE LORD....”

### Lyrics:

You made the starry hosts
You traced the mountain peaks
You paint the evening sky with wonders
The earth, it is Your throne
From desert to the sea
All nature testifies Your splendor

### CHORUS

Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord
Sing His greatness
All creation
Praise the Lord
Raise your voice
You heights and all you depths
From furthest east to west
Let everything that has breath
Praise the Lord

You reached into the dust
In love, Your Spirit breathed
You formed us in Your very likeness
To know Your wondrous works
To tell Your mighty deeds
To join the everlasting chorus

### CHORUS

Let symphonies resound
Let drums and choirs ring out
All heaven hear the sound of worship
Let every nation bring
Its honors to the King
A roar of harmonies eternal

### FINAL CHORUS

Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord
Sing His greatness
All creation
Praise the Lord
Raise your voice
You heights and all you depths
From furthest east to west
You distant burning stars
All creatures near and far
From sky to sea to shore
Sing out forevermore
Let everything that has breath
Praise the Lord
