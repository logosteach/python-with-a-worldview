# Python Basics Worksheet

## Instructions
Complete the following exercises to practice the Python concepts you've learned: data types (int, float, str), variable assignment, naming conventions, the `type()` function, and order of operations (+, -, *, /, **). Write your answers in a Python script or notebook.

## Part 1: Data Types and the `type()` Function
1. **Identify the Data Type**  
   For each value below, write down its data type (int, float, or str). Then, use the `type()` function to confirm your answer in Python.  
   a. `42`  
   b. `"Hello, Python!"`  
   c. `3.14`  
   d. `"123"`  
   e. `0.0`

2. **Type Conversion**  
   Write Python code to:  
   a. Convert the string `"25"` to an integer and print the result.  
   b. Convert the integer `10` to a float and print the result.  
   c. Convert the float `7.5` to a string and print the result.

## Part 2: Variables and Naming Conventions
3. **Variable Assignment**  
   Create variables to store the following information. Use descriptive variable names that follow Python naming conventions (e.g., lowercase with underscores for multiple words).  
   a. Your age as an integer.  
   b. Your height in meters as a float.  
   c. Your first name as a string.  
   Print each variable along with its data type using the `type()` function.

4. **Naming Convention Check**  
   Which of the following variable names follow Python naming conventions? For each, explain why or why not.  
   a. `user_age`  
   b. `2total`  
   c. `firstName`  
   d. `max_speed_limit`  
   e. `MyVariable`

## Part 3: Order of Operations
5. **Calculate with Order of Operations**  
   Evaluate the following expressions by hand, then write Python code to confirm the results. Show your steps for the hand calculations.  
   a. `3 + 5 * 2`  
   b. `(3 + 5) * 2`  
   c. `4 ** 2 / 2`  
   d. `10 - 4 * 2 + 3`  
   e. `2 ** 3 * 4 - 5`

6. **Write Expressions**  
   Write Python expressions to calculate the following:  
   a. The area of a rectangle with a length of 7.5 units and a width of 4 units (area = length * width).  
   b. The total cost of 3 items priced at $2.50 each, with a 10% discount applied to the total.  
   c. The result of raising 5 to the power of 3, then dividing by 2.

## Part 4: Mixed Practice
7. **Variable and Calculation**  
   Write Python code to:  
   a. Create a variable `radius` with the value `2.5` (float).  
   b. Calculate the area of a circle using the formula `area = 3.14 * radius ** 2`.  
   c. Print the area and its data type.

8. **Debug the Code**  
   The following code has errors related to data types, variable names, or operations. Identify and fix the issues, then explain what was wrong.  
   ```python
   myName = "Alex"
   age = "25"
   height = 1.75
   print("My name is" + myName + "and I am" + age + "years old.")
   print("My height is" + height)
