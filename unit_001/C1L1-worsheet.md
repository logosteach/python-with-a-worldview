# Worksheet - C1L1

## Variables and Data Types

## Instructions
Complete the following exercises to practice the Python concepts you've learned: data types (int, float, str), variable assignment, naming conventions, the `type()` function, and order of operations (+, -, *, /, **). Write your answers in a Python script or notebook. Do **not** use type conversion functions (`int()`, `float()`, `str()`) as these have not been covered yet.

## Part 1: Data Types and the `type()` Function
1. **Identify the Data Type**  
   For each value below, write down its data type (int, float, or str). Then, use the `type()` function in Python to confirm your answer.  
   a. `42`  
   b. `"Hello, Python!"`  
   c. `3.14`  
   d. `"123"`  
   e. `0.0`

## Part 2: Variables and Naming Conventions
2. **Variable Assignment**  
   Create variables to store the following information. Use descriptive variable names that follow Python naming conventions (e.g., lowercase with underscores for multiple words).  
   a. Your age as an integer (e.g., `25`).  
   b. Your height in meters as a float (e.g., `1.75`).  
   c. Your first name as a string (e.g., `"Alex"`).  
   Print each variable along with its data type using the `type()` function.

3. **Naming Convention Check**  
   Which of the following variable names follow Python naming conventions? For each, explain why or why not.  
   a. `user_age`  
   b. `2total`  
   c. `firstName`  
   d. `max_speed_limit`  
   e. `MyVariable`

## Part 3: Order of Operations
4. **Calculate with Order of Operations**  
   Evaluate the following expressions by hand, then write Python code to confirm the results. Show your steps for the hand calculations.  
   a. `3 + 5 * 2`  
   b. `(3 + 5) * 2`  
   c. `4 ** 2 / 2`  
   d. `10 - 4 * 2 + 3`  
   e. `2 ** 3 * 4 - 5`

5. **Write Expressions**  
   Write Python expressions to calculate the following:  
   a. The area of a rectangle with a length of 7.5 units and a width of 4 units (area = length * width).  
   b. The total cost of 3 items priced at 2.50 each (no discount, just multiply price by quantity).  
   c. The result of raising 5 to the power of 3, then dividing by 2.

## Part 4: Mixed Practice
6. **Variable and Calculation**  
   Write Python code to:  
   a. Create a variable `radius` with the value `2.5` (float).  
   b. Calculate the area of a circle using the formula `area = 3.14 * radius ** 2`.  
   c. Print the area and its data type using the `type()` function.

7. **Research Online: Debug the Code**  
   The following code has an error related to data types or operations. Identify and fix the issue, then explain what was wrong.  
   ```python
   item_price = 2.50
   quantity = 3
   total_cost = item_price * quantity
   print("Total cost is" + total_cost)
