# Worksheet - C1L2

## Printing and Escape Characters

## Instructions
This worksheet builds on your knowledge from Lesson 1 (data types: int, float, str; variable assignment; naming conventions; `type()` function; order of operations) and introduces new concepts from Lesson 2: the `print()` function, generating basic errors, escape characters (`\n`, `\t`, `\'`), string multipliers, and white space. Complete the exercises below in a Python script or notebook. Do **not** use type conversion functions (`int()`, `float()`, `str()`) as these have not been covered.

## Part 1: The `print()` Function
1. **Basic Printing**  
   Write Python code to:  
   a. Print your name as a string.  
   b. Print your age as an integer.  
   c. Print your height in meters as a float.  
   d. Print a sentence combining all three, e.g., "My name is Alex, I am 25 years old, and my height is 1.75 meters."

2. **Multiple Prints**  
   Write Python code to print the following on separate lines using a single `print()` statement:  
   - "Welcome to Python!"  
   - "This is fun!"  
   - "Let's learn more!"

## Part 2: Generating Basic Errors
3. **Error Exploration**  
   Write Python code that intentionally causes the following errors. After running each, explain what caused the error and how to fix it.  
   a. A `NameError` (e.g., using an undefined variable).  
   b. A `SyntaxError` (e.g., incorrect syntax like a missing parenthesis).  
   c. A `ZeroDivisionError` (e.g., dividing by zero).  

## Part 3: Escape Characters
4. **Using Escape Characters**  
   Write Python code to:  
   a. Print a string with a newline (`\n`) to display "Hello" and "World" on separate lines.  
   b. Print a string with a tab (`\t`) to display "Name: Alex" with a tab between "Name:" and "Alex".  
   c. Print a string using single quotes that includes an apostrophe, e.g., "It's a great day!" using the `\'` escape character.

5. **Creative Use of Escape Characters**  
   Write Python code to print the following exactly as shown (including spacing):
